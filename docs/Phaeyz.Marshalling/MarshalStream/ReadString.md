# MarshalStream.ReadString method (1 of 2)

Reads a string from the stream.

```csharp
public MarshalStreamReadStringResult ReadString(Decoder decoder, int maxBytesToRead, 
    MarshalStreamNullTerminatorBehavior nullTerminatorBehavior)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| decoder | The Decoder object to use for decoding the bytes of the stream into characters. |
| maxBytesToRead | The maximum number of bytes to read from the stream. If -1, then read until the end of the stream. |
| nullTerminatorBehavior | Defines the behavior when null terminators are encountered. |

## Return Value

A task yielding a [`MarshalStreamReadStringResult`](../MarshalStreamReadStringResult.md) object.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | The maximum number of bytes to read is less than zero. |
| DecoderFallbackException | The *decoder*'s Fallback property (or the owning Encoding's DecoderFallback property) is set to DecoderExceptionFallback and a fallback occurred. When this happens, the stream's new position is undefined. |
| IOException | An I/O error occurred. |
| NotSupportedException | The stream is not readable. |
| ObjectDisposedException | The stream is disposed. |
