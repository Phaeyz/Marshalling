# MarshalStream.EnsureByteCountAvailableInBuffer method

Ensures at minimum the specified number of unread bytes is available in the read buffer.

```csharp
public bool EnsureByteCountAvailableInBuffer(int byteCount)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| byteCount | The minimum number of unread bytes which must be available in the read buffer. |

## Return Value

Returns `true` if the specified number of unread bytes is available in the read buffer.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *byteCount* was negative or greater than the total buffer size. |
| IOException | An I/O error occurred. |
| NotSupportedException | The stream is not readable. |
| ObjectDisposedException | The stream is disposed. |

## Remarks

To make the entire read buffer available with unread bytes, use TotalBufferSize as the byte count. A value of zero always returns `true`.
