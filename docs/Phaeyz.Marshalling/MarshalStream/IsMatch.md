# MarshalStream.IsMatch method

Check to see if the next bytes to be read from the stream match the provided sequence of bytes.

```csharp
public bool IsMatch(Span<byte> match, out int bytesRead)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| match | The sequence of bytes to compare against the next bytes to be read from the stream. |
| bytesRead | Receives the number of bytes read from the stream when attempting to do a compare. This may be less than the full length of *match* if the buffer prevents having to increment the read pointer. If `true` is returned, *bytesRead* will be the number of bytes in *match*. |

## Return Value

`true` if the provided sequence of bytes matches the next bytes to be read from the stream.
