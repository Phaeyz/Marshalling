# MarshalStream.EnsureByteCountAvailableInBufferAsync method

Ensures at minimum the specified number of unread bytes is available in the read buffer.

```csharp
public ValueTask<bool> EnsureByteCountAvailableInBufferAsync(int byteCount, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| byteCount | The minimum number of unread bytes which must be available in the read buffer. |
| cancellationToken | A cancellation token which may be used to cancel the operation. |

## Return Value

Returns a task yielding `true` if the specified number of unread bytes is available in the read buffer.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *byteCount* was negative or greater than the total buffer size. |
| IOException | An I/O error occurred. |
| NotSupportedException | The stream is not readable. |
| ObjectDisposedException | The stream is disposed. |
| OperationCanceledException | The cancellation token was canceled. |

## Remarks

To make the entire read buffer available with unread bytes, use TotalBufferSize as the byte count. A value of zero always returns `true`.
