# MarshalStream.WriteString method (1 of 2)

Writes a string to the stream.

```csharp
public int WriteString(Encoder encoder, ReadOnlySpan<char> value, bool writeNullTerminator = false, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| encoder | The Encoder object to use for encoding the characters of the string to bytes onto the stream. |
| value | The string value to write to the stream. |
| writeNullTerminator | If `true` a null terminator will be persisted after the string. The default value is `false`. |
| cancellationToken | A cancellation token which may be used to cancel the operation. |

## Return Value

A task yielding the number of bytes written to the stream.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| EncoderFallbackException | The *encoder*'s Fallback property (or the owning Encoding's EncoderFallback property) is set to EncoderExceptionFallback and a fallback occurred. When this happens, the stream's new position is undefined. |
| IOException | An I/O error occurred. |
| NotSupportedException | The current stream is not writable, or the read buffer cannot be flushed because the current stream is not seekable. |
| ObjectDisposedException | The stream is disposed. |
