# MarshalStreamReadStringResult structure

Used by all `ReadStringAsync` overloads in [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a string read operation.

```csharp
public struct MarshalStreamReadStringResult : IEquatable<MarshalStreamReadStringResult>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| value | The string value which has been read. |
| bytesRead | The number of bytes read from the stream. |
| isEndedDueToNullTerminator | Indicates whether or not a null terminator was encountered while reading from the stream which caused reading to stop. This may only be `true` is the read operation was requested to stop on null terminators. |
| isEndOfStream | Indicates whether or not the end of the stream was reached while reading from the stream. |
