# MarshalStreamMatchResult.BytesRead property

The number of bytes read from the stream, indicating the number of bytes the stream pointer has been advanced.

```csharp
public int BytesRead { get; }
```

## Remarks

The only times this value will be greater than zero is upon a successful match (and then the value will always be the length of byte sequence being matched), or if the stream is encapsulating another stream (not a fixed buffer) and the stream buffer is shorter than the byte sequence being matched. For unsuccessful matches when encapsulating another stream, you can guarantee this will always be zero by ensuring the stream buffer is at least the length of the byte sequence being matched.
