# MarshalStreamNullTerminatorBehavior enumeration

Specifies the behavior of a [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) when it encounters a null terminator.

```csharp
public enum MarshalStreamNullTerminatorBehavior
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ignore | `0` | Null terminators are ignored. |
| Stop | `1` | The stream read operation is stopped after the first null terminator is encountered. The null terminator is omitted from the resulting string. |
| TrimTrailing | `2` | Null terminators are read, however all trailing null terminators are omitted from the resulting string. This is useful when reading a fixed length string with a max number of bytes. |
