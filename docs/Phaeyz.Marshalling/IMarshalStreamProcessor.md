# IMarshalStreamProcessor interface

This interface is usable with [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) to process bytes being read and written.

```csharp
public interface IMarshalStreamProcessor
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Process](IMarshalStreamProcessor/Process.md)(…) | Processes bytes being read or written to a [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) instance. |

## Remarks

The purpose of this interface is to support capabilities such as computing a CRC on a buffered stream, while still keeping stream marshalling as efficient as possible.
