# MarshalStreamMatchResult structure

Used by all `Match` overloads in [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a match operation.

```csharp
public struct MarshalStreamMatchResult : IEquatable<MarshalStreamMatchResult>
```

| parameter | description |

| success | If `true` the match was successful; `false` otherwise. |
| bytesRead | The number of bytes read from the stream, indicating the number of bytes the stream pointer has been advanced. |
| isEndOfStream | Indicates whether or not the end of the stream was reached while matching from the stream. |
