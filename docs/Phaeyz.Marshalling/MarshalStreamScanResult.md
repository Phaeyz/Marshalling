# MarshalStreamScanResult structure

Used by scan methods in [`MarshalStream`](./MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a scan operation.

```csharp
public struct MarshalStreamScanResult : IEquatable<MarshalStreamScanResult>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| bytesRead | The total number of bytes read during the scan operation. |
| isPositiveMatch | `true` if the scan found a successful match, `false` otherwise. |
| isEndOfStream | `true` if the end of the stream was reached during scanning, `false` otherwise. |
