# ByteConverter class

Utility methods for efficiently reading and writing intrinsic values to and from a byte sequence, while honoring the byte order of the values.

```csharp
public class ByteConverter
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [BigEndian](ByteConverter/BigEndian.md) { get; } | Gets an instance of ByteConverter which reads values with a big endian byte order. |
| static [LittleEndian](ByteConverter/LittleEndian.md) { get; } | Gets an instance of ByteConverter which reads values with a little endian byte order. |
| static [SystemEndian](ByteConverter/SystemEndian.md) { get; } | Gets an instance of ByteConverter which reads values with the byte order of the native platform. |
| [IsLittleEndian](ByteConverter/IsLittleEndian.md) { get; } | Determines whether or not the ByteConverter instance is little endian byte order. |
| [CopyTo](ByteConverter/CopyTo.md)(…) | Copies a byte sequence to a target byte sequence. (21 methods) |
| [FromBoolean](ByteConverter/FromBoolean.md)(…) | Writes boolean (a one-byte value where zero is `false`, non-zero is `true`) to a buffer. |
| [FromByte](ByteConverter/FromByte.md)(…) | Writes an unsigned 8-bit value to a buffer. |
| [FromDouble](ByteConverter/FromDouble.md)(…) | Writes a 64-bit floating-point value to a buffer. |
| [FromInt16](ByteConverter/FromInt16.md)(…) | Writes a signed 8-bit value to a buffer. |
| [FromInt32](ByteConverter/FromInt32.md)(…) | Writes a signed 32-bit value to a buffer. |
| [FromInt64](ByteConverter/FromInt64.md)(…) | Writes a signed 64-bit value to a buffer. |
