# MarshalStreamReadStringResult.BytesRead property

The number of bytes read from the stream.

```csharp
public int BytesRead { get; }
```

## Remarks

This may be zero if `maxBytesToRead` if also zero which in that case `EndOfStreamReached` will also be false. If reading started at the end of stream and the maximum number of bytes is greater than zero, this will be zero and `EndOfStreamReached` will be true.
