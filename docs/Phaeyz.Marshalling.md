## Phaeyz.Marshalling namespace

| public type | description |
| --- | --- |
| class [ByteConverter](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/ByteConverter.md) | Utility methods for efficiently reading and writing intrinsic values to and from a byte sequence, while honoring the byte order of the values. |
| class [ByteCountingStream](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/ByteCountingStream.md) | An extremely light-weight stream that counts the number of bytes written to it. The written bytes are discarded after being counted. The stream is not readable or seekable. |
| struct [Crc32](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/Crc32.md) | An implementation of a 32-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). |
| static class [EncodingExtensions](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/EncodingExtensions.md) | Utility methods for text encoding. |
| interface [IMarshalStreamProcessor](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/IMarshalStreamProcessor.md) | This interface is usable with [`MarshalStream`](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) to process bytes being read and written. |
| class [MarshalStream](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) | A stream similar to BufferedStream but provides access to the read buffer, making the stream ideal for parsing and scanning. |
| struct [MarshalStreamMatchResult](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStreamMatchResult.md) | Used by all `Match` overloads in [`MarshalStream`](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a match operation. |
| enum [MarshalStreamNullTerminatorBehavior](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStreamNullTerminatorBehavior.md) | Specifies the behavior of a [`MarshalStream`](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) when it encounters a null terminator. |
| struct [MarshalStreamReadStringResult](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStreamReadStringResult.md) | Used by all `ReadStringAsync` overloads in [`MarshalStream`](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a string read operation. |
| struct [MarshalStreamScanResult](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStreamScanResult.md) | Used by scan methods in [`MarshalStream`](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/MarshalStream.md) to return the result of a scan operation. |
| class [ScopedReadStream](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/ScopedReadStream.md) | A stream for wrapping another stream, and limiting the number of bytes which may be read. |
| static class [StreamExtensions](./Phaeyz.Marshalling/StreamExtensions.md) | Utility methods for reading and writing intrinsic values from a stream. |
